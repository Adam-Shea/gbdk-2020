\item Updated documentation
\item Library was improved
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Linking with stdio.\+h does not require that much R\+OM now
\item Default font is changed to the smaller one (102 characters), that leaves space for user tiles
\item Fixed broken support for multiplying longs
\item memset/memcpy minor enhancements
\item safer copy-\/to-\/\+V\+R\+AM functions
\item loading of 1bit data fixed, also now it is possible to specify pixel color

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Updated A\+PI documentation
\item I\+HX is checked for correctness before the makebin stage. That allows to warn about overwriting the same R\+OM addresses (S\+D\+CC toolchain does not check this anymore).
\item Library was improved
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item set\+\_\+$\ast$\+\_\+tiles() now wrap maps around horizontal and vertical boundaries correctly
\item new fill\+\_\+$\ast$\+\_\+rect() functions to clear rectangle areas
\item runtime initialization code now does not initialize whole W\+R\+AM with zeros anymore, that allows B\+GB to raise exceptions when code tries to read W\+R\+AM that was not written before.
\item enhanced S\+GB support
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item G\+B\+DK now requires S\+D\+CC 4.\+0.\+3 or higher, that has fully working toolchain. Old link-\/gbz80 linker is not used anymore, sdldgb and makebin are used to link objects and produce binary roms; maccer tool is no longer needed either
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+D\+CC 4.\+0.\+3 has much better code generator which produces smaller and faster code. Code is twice faster
\item S\+O\+U\+R\+CE L\+E\+V\+EL D\+E\+B\+U\+G\+G\+I\+NG is possible now! Native toolchain produces $\ast$.C\+DB files that contain detailed debug info. Look for E\+M\+U\+L\+I\+C\+I\+O\+US extension for vs.\+code. It supports breakpoints, watches, inspection of local variables, and more!
\item S\+D\+CC 4.\+0.\+4 has fixed R\+G\+B\+DS support; library is not updated to support that in full yet, but it is possible to assemble and link code emitted by S\+D\+CC with R\+G\+D\+BS
\item New banked trampolines are used, they are faster and smaller
\item New (old) initialization for non-\/constant arrays do N\+OT require 5 times larger rom space than initialized array itself, S\+D\+CC even tries to compress the data
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Library was improved
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item itoa/ltoa functions were rewritten, div/mod is not required now which is about 10 times faster
\item sprite functions are inline now, which is faster up to 12 times and produces the same or smaller code; .O\+AM symbol is renamed into \+\_\+shadow\+\_\+\+O\+AM that allows accessing shadow O\+AM directly from C code
\item interrupt handling was revised, it is now possible to make dedicated I\+SR\textquotesingle{}s, that is important for time-\/sensitive handlers such as H\+Blank.
\item printf/sprintf were rewritten and splitted, print functions are twice faster now and also requre less rom space if you use \mbox{\hyperlink{stdio_8h_a31913a297ee18548c81d482ef6bdbe0f}{sprintf()}} only, say, in bgb\+\_\+emu.\+h
\item crash\+\_\+handler.\+h -\/ crash handler that allows to detect problems with R\+O\+Ms after they are being released (adapted handler, originally written by I\+S\+S\+Otm)
\item improved and fixed string.\+h
\item many other improvements and fixes -\/ thanks to all contributors!

 Many changes. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Code generated is now much more reliable and passes all of sdcc\textquotesingle{}s regression suite.
\item Added support for large sets of local variables ($>$127 bytes).
\item Added full 32 bit long support.
\item Still no floating pt support.

19th August, 2000 ~\newline



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Stopped lcc with sdcc from leaking .cdb files all across /tmp.
\item Optimised $<$ and $>$ for 16 bit varibles.
\item Added a new lexer to sdcc. Compiling files with large initalised arrays takes 31\% of the time (well, at least samptest.\+c does \+:) ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

This is an experimental release for those who feel keen. The main change is a new lexer (the first part in the compilation process which recognises words and symbols like \textquotesingle{}!=\textquotesingle{} and \textquotesingle{}char\textquotesingle{} and turns them into a token number) which speeds up compilation of large initialised arrays like tile data by a factor of three. Please report any bugs that show up -\/ this is a big change.

I have also included a \textquotesingle{}minimal\textquotesingle{} release for win32 users which omits the documentation, library sources, and examples. If this is useful I will keep doing it.\hypertarget{docs_releases_autotoc_md198}{}\doxysubsubsection{G\+B\+D\+K 2.\+95-\/2}\label{docs_releases_autotoc_md198}
5th August, 2000 ~\newline
 Just a small update. From the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added model switching support --model-\/medium uses near (16 bit) pointers for data, and banked calls for anything not declared as \textquotesingle{}nonbanked\textquotesingle{} --model-\/small uses near (16 bit) pointers for data and calls. Nothing uses banked calls. \textquotesingle{}nonbanked\textquotesingle{} functions are still placed in H\+O\+ME. Libraries are under lib/medium and lib/small.
\item Added the gbdk version to \textquotesingle{}sdcc --version\textquotesingle{}
\item Changed the ways globals are exported, reducing the amount of extra junk linked in.
\item Turned on the optimisations in flex. Large constant arrays like tile data should compile a bit faster.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{docs_releases_autotoc_md199}{}\doxysubsubsection{G\+B\+D\+K 2.\+95}\label{docs_releases_autotoc_md199}
22nd July, 2000
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed \textquotesingle{}a $<$$<$ c\textquotesingle{} for c = \mbox{[}9..15\mbox{]}
\item no\$gmb doesn\textquotesingle{}t support labels of $>$ 32 chars. The linker now trims all labels to 31 chars long.
\item Fixed wait\+\_\+vbl for the case where you miss a vbl
\item Fixed + and -\/ for any type where sizeof == 2 and one of the terms was on the stack. This includes pointers and ints. Fixes the text output bug in the examples. Should be faster now as well. Note that + and -\/ for longs is still broken.
\item Fixed the missing $\ast$/ in gb.\+h
\item Added basic far function support. Currently only works for isas and rgbasm. See examples/gb/far/$\ast$
\item bc is now only pushed if the function uses it. i.\+e. something like\+: int silly(int i) \{ return i; \} ~\newline
 will not have the push bc; pop bc around it.
\item Better rgbasm support. Basically\+: o Use \char`\"{}sdcc -\/mgbz80 -\/-\/asm=rgbds file.\+c\char`\"{} for each file.\+c o Use \char`\"{}sdcc -\/mgbz80 -\/-\/asm=rgbds crt0.\+o gbz80.\+lib gb.\+lib file1.\+o file2.\+o...\char`\"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}

to link everything together. The .lib files are generated using astorgb.\+pl and sdcc to turn the gbdk libraries into something rgbds compatible. The libraries are {\itshape not} fully tested. Trust nothing. But give it a go \+:)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Ran a spell checker across the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME and Change\+Log ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

This is a recommended upgrade. Some of the big features are\+:

Decent rgbds support. All the libraries and most of the examples can now compile with rgbds as the assembler. Banked function support. It is now easier to break the 32k barrier from within C. Functions can live in and be called transparently from any bank. Only works with rgbds Fixed some decent bugs with R\+SH, L\+SH, and a nasty bug with + and -\/ for int\textquotesingle{}s and pointers. Various optimisations in the code generator.

7th July, 2000 ~\newline
 Information on float and long support. Someone asked about the state of float/long support recently. Heres my reply\+:

long support is partly there, as is float support. The compiler will correctly recognise the long and float keywords, and will generate the code for most basic ops (+, -\/, \&, $\vert$ etc) for longs correctly and will generate the function calls for floats and hard long operations ($\ast$, /, \%) correctly. However it wont generate float constants in the correct format, nor will it \textquotesingle{}return\textquotesingle{} a long or float -\/ gbdk doesn\textquotesingle{}t yet support returning types of 4 bytes. Unfortunately its not going to make it into 2.\+95 as there\textquotesingle{}s too much else to do, but I should be able to complete long support for 2.\+96\hypertarget{docs_releases_autotoc_md200}{}\doxysubsubsection{G\+B\+D\+K 2.\+94}\label{docs_releases_autotoc_md200}
7th May, 2000 ~\newline
 Many fixes -\/ see the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME for more.

7th May -\/ Library documentation up. A good size part of the libraries that go with gbdk have been documented -\/ follow the H\+T\+ML link above to have a look. Thanks to quang for a good chunk of the gb.\+h documentation. Please report any errors \+:)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed \#define B\+L\+AH 7 // Unterminated \textquotesingle{} error in sdcpp
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed S\+C\+Y\+\_\+\+R\+EG += 2, S\+C\+Y\+\_\+\+R\+EG -\/= 5 (add and subtract in indirect space) as they were both quite broken.
\item externs and static\textquotesingle{}s now work as expected.
\item You can now specify which bank code should be put into using a \#pragma e.\+g\+: \#pragma bank=H\+O\+ME Under rgbds and asxxxx putting code in the H\+O\+ME bank will force the code into bank 0 -\/ useful for library functions. The most recent \#pragma bank= will be the one used for the whole file.
\item Fixed an interesting bug in the caching of lit addresses
\item Added support for accessing high registers directly using the \textquotesingle{}sfr\textquotesingle{} directive. See libc/gb/sfr.\+s and gb/hardware.\+h for an example. It should be possible with a bit of work to make high ram directly usable by the compiler; at the moment it is experimental. You can test sfr\textquotesingle{}s by enabling U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+S\+F\+R\+\_\+\+F\+O\+R\+\_\+\+R\+EG=1
\item Added remove\+\_\+\+V\+BL etc functions.
\item Documented the libs -\/ see the gbdk-\/doc tarball distributed seperatly.
\item Two dimensional arrays seem to be broken.

 From the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added multi-\/bank support into the compiler -\/ The old -\/Wf-\/boxx and -\/Wf-\/baxx options now work
\item Has preliminary support for generating rgbds and I\+S\+AS compatible assembler. Try -\/W--asm=rgbds or -\/W--asm=isas. The I\+S\+AS code is untested as I dont have access to the real assembler.
\item R\+SH is fixed
\item A\+ND is fixed
\item The missing parts of 2.\+1.\+0\textquotesingle{}s libs are there. Note\+: They are untested.
\item The dscan demo now fully works (with a hack \+:)
\item There is a bug with cached computed values which are later used as pointers. When the value is first used as a B\+Y\+TE arg, then later as a pointer the pointer fails as the high byte was never computed and is now missing. A temporary fix is to declare something appropriate as \textquotesingle{}volatile\textquotesingle{} to stop the value being cached. See dscan.\+c/bombs() for an example.

 This is a maintenance release for win32 which fixes some of the niggly install problems, especially\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item win32 only. Takes care of some of the install bugs, including\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Now auto detects where it is installed. This can be overridden using set G\+B\+D\+K\+D\+IR=...
\item Problems with the installer (now uses Win\+Zip)

\item cygwin1.\+dll and \textquotesingle{}make\textquotesingle{} are no longer required gbdk is now built using mingw32 which is win32 native make.\+bat is automagically generated from the Makefile
\item I\textquotesingle{}ve reverted to using W\+O\+RD for signed 16 bit etc. G\+B\+D\+K\+\_\+2\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+AT is no longer required.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

W\+O\+R\+DS are now back to signed. G\+B\+D\+K\+\_\+2\+\_\+\+C\+O\+M\+P\+AT is no longer needed. Temporary files are created in T\+MP, T\+E\+MP, or T\+M\+P\+D\+IR instead of c\+: tmp The installer is no more as it\textquotesingle{}s not needed. There is a Win\+Zip wrapped version for those with the extra bandwidth \+:). gbdk autodetects where it is installed -\/ no more environment variables. cygwin1.\+dll and make are no longer required -\/ gbdk is now compiled with mingw32.

See the Change\+Log section in the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME for more information.

 Problems with the installer. It seems that the demo of Install\+V\+I\+SE has an unreasonably short time limit. I had planed to use the demo until the license key came through, but there\textquotesingle{}s no sign of the key yet and the 3 day evaluation is up. If anyone knows of a free Windows installer with the ability to modify environment variables, please contact me. I hear that temporarily setting you clock back to the 15th works...

 libc5 version available / \char`\"{}\+Error creating temp file\char`\"{} Thanks to Rodrigo Couto there is now a Linux/libc5 version of gbdk3-\/2.\+92 available -\/ follow the download link above. At least it will be there when the main sourceforge site comes back up... Also some people have reported a bug where the compiler reports \textquotesingle{}$\ast$$\ast$$\ast$ Error creating temp file\textquotesingle{}. Try typing \char`\"{}mkdir c\+: tmp\char`\"{} from a D\+OS prompt and see if that helps.\hypertarget{docs_releases_autotoc_md203}{}\doxysubsubsection{G\+B\+D\+K 2.\+92}\label{docs_releases_autotoc_md203}

 Better than 2.\+91 \+:). Can now be installed anywhere. All the demos work. See the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME for more.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All the examples now work (with a little bit of patching \+:)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed problem with registers being cached instead of being marked volatile.
\item More register packing -\/ should be a bit faster.
\item You can now install somewhere except c\+: gbdk $\vert$ /usr/lib/gbdk
\item Arrays initialised with constant addresses a\textquotesingle{}la galaxy.\+c now work.
\item Fixed minor bug with 104\$\+: labels in as.
\item Up to 167d/s... ~\newline

 Better than 2.\+90 and includes Linux, win32 and a source tar ball. Some notes\+:

Read the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME first Linux users need libgc-\/4 or above. Debian users try apt-\/get install libgc5. All the types have changed. Again, please read the R\+E\+A\+D\+ME first. I prefer release early, release often. The idea is to get the bugs out there so that they can be squashed quickly. I\textquotesingle{}ve split up the libs so that they can be used on other platforms and so that the libs can be updated without updating the compiler. One side effect is that gb specific files have been shifted into their own directory i.\+e. gb.\+h is now gb/gb.\+h.

 First release of gbdk/sdcc. This is an early release -\/ the only binary is for Linux and the source is only available through cvs. If your interested in the source, have a look at the cvs repository gbdk-\/support first, which will download all the rest of the code. Alternatively, look at gbdk-\/support and gbdk-\/lib at cvs.\+gbdk.\+sourceforge.\+net and sdcc at cvs.\+sdcc.\+sourceforge.\+net. I will be working on binaries for Win32 and a source tar ball soon. Please report any bugs through the bugs link above.

 Added Dermot\textquotesingle{}s far pointer spec. It\textquotesingle{}s mainly here for comment. If sdcc is ported to the Gameboy then I will be looking for some way to do far calls.

 Moved over to sourceforge.\+net. Thanks must go to David Pfeffer for gbdk\textquotesingle{}s previous resting place, www.\+gbdev.\+org. The transition is not complete, but cvs and web have been shifted. Note that the cvs download instructions are stale -\/ you should now look to cvs.\+gbdk.\+sourceforge.\+net. I am currently working on porting sdcc over to the Z80. David Nathan is looking at porting it to the GB.

The compiler is the same, but some of the libraries have been improved. \mbox{\hyperlink{asm_2gbz80_2string_8h_a4bc4146b1a053fc4ec10f1377bb21a4f}{memset()}} and \mbox{\hyperlink{asm_2gbz80_2string_8h_a6a1a6cbe7fb6102819098340a4986574}{memcpy()}} are much faster, \mbox{\hyperlink{stdlib_8h_a7ac38fce3243a7dcf448301ee9ffd392}{malloc()}} is fixed, and a high speed fixed block alternative \mbox{\hyperlink{stdlib_8h_a7ac38fce3243a7dcf448301ee9ffd392}{malloc()}} was added.
